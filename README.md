# odin-mastermind

odin project: mastermind. implement the game Mastermind to be run on the command line with 12 turns to guess the right code
                this implementation will have codes of length 4, with total 6 unique colors
                white key pegs: represents that a correct color was guessed, but it is in the wrong spot
                black key pegs: represents that a correct color was guessed and is in the correct spot
                unlike wordle: these pegs will not tell you any additional information besides the count (such as which position a peg represents)

                in this implementation, the human user will be the guesser and the computer will generate a random code every time
